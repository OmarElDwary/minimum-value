## Get the minimum value of a List


# Features:
- Enables user to find minimum value of a list with 2 ways.
- First way is to use .sort() method of lists in dart which will mutate the array and sort it from least to largest and the order of the list will be changed to that one after sorting then we will return the 0 index of the list.
- Another way using buble sort method in which we will make an outer loop to control the number of number of passes and the 2nd loop will compare between each two adjacent list elements.
